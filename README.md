Two test project in this repo:
- lein-shadow
- shadow-cljs

For lein-shadow, run two cmd in two terminals:

    lein shadow npm-deps
    lein shadow watch app

Then visit: http://localhost:8000

Material UI works fine.


For shadow-cljs, run two cmd in two terminals:

    npm install
    shadow-cljs watch home app

Then visit: http://localhost:8000

The menu structure is in chaos!
